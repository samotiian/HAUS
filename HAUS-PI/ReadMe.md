 ## Annotation Files Format
1. Each Mat file corresponds to a video with the same name.
2. Each Mat file contains 4 objects:
* <b>Frame:</b> Contains those frame numbers that at least one person is visible in camera.
* <b>LabelActive:</b> It corresponds to the Frame matrix. It is 0 when individuals are not active. It is 1 when individuals are active 
(an interaction is obviously happening).
* <b>pts:</b> Contains bounding-box information of individuals in videos (top left and bottom right). 
* <b>Pmatrix:</b> Contains p-matrix.
